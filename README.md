# Counter App

This repo holds two implementations of the same app. Both are a basic counter app with child and grandchild component communication.

* **Implementation without Redux**: This implementation uses inputs/outputs and emmiters inside of the child and grandchild components to make the data communication work.
*  **Implementation with Redux**: This implementation uses the Redux pattern (Store, actions, reducers and states) to make the comunication work.
